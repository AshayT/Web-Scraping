Image quality is very good, autofocus is lightning fast and accurate, detail is high, and colors are generally pleasant. Apple remains a leader in preview performance, so what you see when composing a shot looks a lot like the final result. Dynamic range could be better, but mobile photographers should be pleased overall.This iPhone’s weakest link is its lack of long zoom capability, something we’re seeing more of in flagships from the competition. If reach is paramount to you, then there are other phones that excel in this metric (but none that run iOS).Video performance overall is excellent, just short of the best we’ve seen. Wide dynamic range, good color, low noise, and effective stabilization make this iPhone a good choice for users who prioritize video capabilities.For mobile photographers committed to the iOS ecosystem and ready to part with the hefty purchase price, the iPhone 12 Pro Max shouldn’t disappoint.',\n",

A14 Bionic crushes everything you can throw at it with it keeping apps open in the background with zero issues. The battery lasts all day. The camera is amazing and it’s quite a big improvement coming from an iPhone 7 Plus. The screen is vibrant and the speakers sound like a good quality Bluetooth speaker. The pacific blue color is beautiful as well. Looks like grey in certain lighting. However, since this is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made, I would recommend holding the phone in person before buying as this phone is huge & some people can find it uncomfortable at 6.7 inches. Many people can get 90% of what this phone offers in the smaller 12 Pro. That being said, if you want the biggest screen, the biggest battery on an iPhone and as long as you know what you’re getting into with the size, and you have the money to spend, would recommend this phone 10/10.',\n",

Performance wise it’s a beast of a phone, with a much superior processor and chipset than it’s competition and predecessors. Delivering benchmark quality in every single aspect.So yeah, all in all an extremely worthy buy if you can afford that kind of money for a phone.

The real problem is it is 1.4Lakh rs while average people earn 30k rs per month. While outside india (eg. U.S) the price is $1,100 while average people earns $5,000 per month. so if youre in U.S you can just get an iphone and live accordingly with rest money. but in India , youll have to take the entire salary + sell your kidney + borrow extra money to live after everything.I suggest to get a phone like this after settling outside or be ready to donate some organs.',\n",

       " \"  I have been into apple ecosystem since iPhone 4s.Since Apple started to move to larger displays they eventually let go the square design which I was missing a lot and did not hope that It ll ever comeback.The time when I saw they are bringing back the squared flat design I was blown away.I pre-ordered from Amazon as soon as it was available.Thanks to amazon I got the delivery on 14th.As soon as I unboxed it I was like wow.The phone feels ultra premium in hand with stainless steel borders and matte finish back.The display lives upto the standards of Apple.Battery life is at par with last year iPhones,though on paper it has a smaller battery.Coming to the camera samples it is again the best camera in a smartphone curretly.The 10bit HDR video is amazing.They have incorporated sensor shift stabilization which I am yet to test.Some of the pros and cons :Pros :DesignLow light camera shotsHDR VideoBattery lifeA14 5nm bionic chipCons:Price is relatively high compared to other marketsNo Charging adapter(might be a huge letdown for people newly moving to iOS)No high refresh rate displays(Although the display does not feel slow )What I felt :I upgraded from 11 Pro Max.For an average user you ll not find a huge difference in terms of overall usage and experience.The size might not be a fit for everyone since its really huge.I am yet to test the magsafe accessories as these aren't available on Amazon yet.So if some one looking to upgrade from iPhone XS or older ,will be a huge upgrade in terms of camera ,performance,battery life etc.Overall,its actually the best iPhone with the all time fav design WITH AN ULTRA PRO MAX PREMIUM COST :p(I ll add camera samples and edit this review after few months of usage)\",\n",

Could this phone have been more reasonably priced, definitely yes but no one flashed their iPhones or “i” anything because they were so cheap to buy and maintain.
